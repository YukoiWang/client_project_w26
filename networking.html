    <h2>Build Meaningful Professional Relationships</h2>
    <p>
      Networking is one of the most powerful tools in your career development toolkit. It's not just about collecting business cards or LinkedIn connections—it's about building genuine relationships that can open doors, provide mentorship, and create opportunities throughout your career journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      At UMSI, we believe that strong professional networks are built on authentic connections, mutual respect, and a willingness to both give and receive support. Whether you're reaching out to alumni, attending industry events, or engaging in informational interviews, these resources will help you navigate networking with confidence and authenticity.

    <h2>Networking Fundamentals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start with Your Existing Network:</strong> Friends, family, classmates, professors, and former colleagues are all part of your network. Don't underestimate these connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Be Genuine and Authentic:</strong> Focus on building real relationships, not just transactional connections. Show genuine interest in others.</li>
      <li><strong>Give Before You Ask:</strong> Offer help, share resources, or provide value before asking for favors. Networking is a two-way street.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow Up and Stay Connected:</strong> Maintain relationships over time. Send thank-you notes, share updates, and check in periodically.</li>
      <li><strong>Attend Events and Join Communities:</strong> Participate in UMSI events, industry meetups, and professional organizations relevant to your interests.</li>

    <h2>Networking Best Practices</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prepare Your Elevator Pitch:</strong> Be ready to introduce yourself clearly and concisely, highlighting your interests and goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Do Your Research:</strong> Before reaching out or attending events, research the people and organizations you want to connect with.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask Thoughtful Questions:</strong> Show genuine curiosity about others' experiences, career paths, and insights.</li>
      <li><strong>Listen Actively:</strong> Pay attention to what others are saying and respond thoughtfully. Good networking is about listening as much as talking.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow Up Promptly:</strong> Send a thank-you message within 24-48 hours of meeting someone or having a conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintain Your Network:</strong> Stay in touch periodically, share updates about your progress, and offer help when you can.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Networking FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>How do I reach out to someone I don't know?</strong><br>
        Start with a warm introduction if possible, or send a brief, personalized message explaining why you're reaching out and what you hope to learn. Be respectful of their time and make a specific, reasonable request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What should I ask in an informational interview?</strong><br>
        Focus on learning about their career path, industry insights, and advice. Avoid asking for a job directly. Use the TIARA method to structure your questions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How often should I follow up with my network?</strong><br>
        There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but aim to check in every few months or when you have meaningful updates to share. Don't only reach out when you need something.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Is LinkedIn enough for networking?</strong><br>
        LinkedIn is a valuable tool, but in-person and virtual events, informational interviews, and genuine conversations are equally important. Use LinkedIn to maintain connections, not as your only networking strategy.
      </li>
    </ul>
